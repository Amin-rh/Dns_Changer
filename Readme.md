Well, first of all, hello, I'm Amin, and this is the second project I'm uploading on GitHub.i want to share with you a useful program to change your dns quickly and I hope it will help you.
we see 3 files in this project one of them is the 'Readme.md' and you'r reading it now but there are also two other files:
1.dns_changer.py :
it's that file i said, we can change our dns with this program. i created this program with python programming language like pervious project (The best way).
2.how_it_works.md
in this file you can learn how to use this program.

as always i want to give you a suggestion, first you open 'how_it_works.md' and read until when you understood what should you do then open 'dns_changer.py'.

Good Luck.
